## I. Detailed feedback per criteria

This exploration demonstrates exceptional personal engagement, critical thinking, and a profound ability to link mathematical analysis with real-world health issues. The student consistently provides thoughtful justifications for methodological choices, interprets complex results like negative x-values with nuanced contextual understanding, and reflects deeply on limitations and future research. The document is generally well-organized and coherent, showcasing a strong grasp of the research question and demonstrating substantial personal initiative.

However, a critical overarching limitation is the absence of all referenced figures (1-6) and appendices (A, B, C). Their omission significantly impedes the assessment of presentation, visual data interpretation, and the verification of mathematical accuracy and rigor. Key areas for improvement also include enhancing precision in mathematical communication—such as correcting axis labels (e.g., Figure 1), ensuring consistent numerical precision (s.f./d.p.), and refining algebraic presentation, particularly for steps involving the quadratic formula. Furthermore, careful re-verification of all mathematical calculations, especially for maxima and minima, is essential to ensure consistent accuracy. Integrating mathematical functions earlier in the text, improving table and graph labeling with explicit units, and standardizing referencing consistency will further elevate the document's clarity and completeness. Addressing these points will transform an already insightful piece into a truly exemplary mathematical exploration.
