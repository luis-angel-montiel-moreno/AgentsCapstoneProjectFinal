Consolidated feedback report

---
## I. Detailed feedback per criteria

This report synthesizes feedback from multiple reviewers on an internal assessment about breast cancer death rates in women. The work demonstrates strong engagement with a relevant global health issue, effectively using mathematical tools for analysis.

**Common Themes and Key Takeaways:**

*   **Strong Mathematical Application:** Reviewers consistently praise the student's effective use of polynomial functions (degrees 3 and 4), calculus (derivatives for extrema), and algebraic manipulation (solving systems of equations for intersections). The interpretation of R² values and the handling of complex equations using a GDC are also noted strengths.
*   **Clear Communication and Structure:** The document is generally well-organized with clear headings, and the explanations of mathematical procedures are mostly logical. The use of GeoGebra for visualization and verification is a positive aspect.
*   **Personal Engagement and Reflection:** The student expresses genuine interest in the topic, linking it to the power of mathematics in solving real-world problems. They also demonstrate critical reflection by acknowledging limitations, discussing anomalies (like negative x-values), and suggesting future research directions.

**Areas for Improvement Highlighted Across Reviews:**

*   **Clarity in Function Definitions and Notation:** A recurring issue is the ambiguity surrounding the specific polynomial functions used for each country and degree (e.g., `i1(x)` vs. `i2(x)`). Explicitly defining these at the outset and consistently referencing them is crucial.
*   **Consistency in Presentation:** Several reviewers noted inconsistencies in significant figures, data rounding, and table/figure labeling. Standardizing these elements would enhance clarity and professionalism.
*   **Depth of Justification and Interpretation:** While mathematical methods are applied, further justification for specific choices (e.g., why degree 3 vs. 4 polynomials) and deeper connections between mathematical findings and real-world implications (health policies, socio-economic factors) are recommended. Explicitly linking limitations to conclusions and developing more concrete recommendations would also strengthen the analysis.
*   **Explicitly Addressing Assessment Criteria:** While the work aligns with criteria, explicitly referencing how specific sections address each criterion could be beneficial for grading.

**Surprising Connections:**

The unexpected negative x-values arising from polynomial extrapolation for Romania were interpreted not just as a mathematical artifact but as a potential reflection of data instability or inconsistencies related to the country's historical context (e.g., under communism). This demonstrates a nuanced approach, connecting mathematical behavior to real-world circumstances.

**Most Important Key Takeaways for the Student:**

1.  **Prioritize Clarity in Mathematical Notation:** Precisely define all functions, variables, and their units. Ensure consistency in referencing them throughout the document.
2.  **Refine Data Presentation and Consistency:** Standardize significant figures and ensure all figures and tables are clearly labeled with units and relevant information.
3.  **Deepen Analysis and Interpretation:** Connect mathematical findings more explicitly to the real-world context, justify model choices thoroughly, and draw specific, actionable recommendations from the analysis. Critically evaluate the limitations and their impact on conclusions.
