## Feedback Report: Creative Composition Problem

**Overall Score: 4.0/5.0**

This document presents a comprehensive and well-structured exploration of the "Creative Composition Problem" (CCP) within the context of an AI-powered digital companion for mental well-being. The authors clearly define the problem, propose a novel solution, and detail its implementation within the "Cecilia" architecture. The paper is well-written, technically sound, and contributes significantly to the field.

---

### Criterion 1: Problem Definition and Clarity

**Score: 5.0/5.0**

**Justification:**
The problem of "Creative Composition Problem" (CCP) and its specific instantiation, "The Problem of Creating a Dialogue Composition" (PCDC), are very clearly defined. The authors meticulously explain the components of the problem, including AI-tasks, profits, interaction lengths, and the goal of optimizing mental health and well-being alongside dialogue smoothness, coherence, enjoyment, and engagement. The definition is precise, mathematical, and well-grounded in the application domain.

**Actionable Feedback for Improvement:**

1.  **Consider a more intuitive initial explanation of PCDC:** While the formal definition is excellent, a slightly more narrative or analogy-based introduction to PCDC in the abstract or introduction might help readers grasp the core challenge before diving into the formal definitions. For example, likening it to composing a personalized playlist that optimizes user engagement and mood, rather than just a sequence of songs.
2.  **Elaborate on the "profit" calculation:** While the paper mentions that profits are associated with AI-tasks and pairs of micro-dialogues, and that these are defined by logical theories in ASP, a brief example or a more detailed explanation of *how* a specific profit value is derived (e.g., "if student expresses anxiety, a mindfulness exercise AI-task gets a high profit value") would further clarify this crucial aspect of the CCP.
3.  **Visual Aid for Problem Components:** While the figures illustrating the Cecilia architecture are helpful, consider adding a small, dedicated diagram or a more elaborate visual representation specifically for the components of the CCP graph instance (V, E, Pv, PE, Wv) in Section 4.1. This could help readers quickly visualize the elements being optimized.

---

### Criterion 2: Technical Soundness and Methodology

**Score: 4.5/5.0**

**Justification:**
The technical foundation of the paper is strong. The use of Knowledge Graphs, Knowledge Representation, and logic-based AI (specifically Answer Set Programming - ASP) is well-justified and explained. The dynamic programming approach for solving the CCP is clearly articulated, and the algorithms are presented. The connection to established problems like Knapsack and Traveling Salesman Problem adds credibility. The implementation details, including the Master-Agent Artificial Intelligent Composer (MAIC) and the use of BSRL scripts, are also well-described.

**Actionable Feedback for Improvement:**

1.  **Clarify the "NP-Hard" implication for practical use:** While the paper correctly identifies the potential NP-Hard nature of the problem and discusses parameterized complexity, it would be beneficial to explicitly address how this translates to real-time performance for a dialogue session. The paper mentions that diagnostics and prescriptions are not computed in real-time, but further elaboration on the computational feasibility for generating *actual* dialogue sequences in a timely manner would be valuable.
2.  **Provide more concrete examples of ASP theories:** While Section 5.1 lists several "Theories" (Hobbies Theory, Emotional Well-being Theory, etc.) used in ASP, providing a very brief, simplified example of one of these theories in ASP syntax would significantly enhance understanding of their practical implementation within the MAIC. For instance, a single rule for the "Hobbies Theory" or "Emotional Well-being Theory."
3.  **Expand on the "Proof of Concept" strategy:** Section 5 mentions that the feasibility of the Cecilia design follows a "Proof of Concept strategy." While this is understandable for a research paper, elaborating slightly on what this entails (e.g., specific testing methodologies, initial user feedback integration beyond pre-evaluation) could strengthen the confidence in the proposed solution's practical viability.

---

### Criterion 3: Novelty and Contribution

**Score: 4.5/5.0**

**Justification:**
The paper presents a novel approach to the "Creative Composition Problem" tailored for mental well-being optimization. The formalization of CCP and PCDC, and their instantiation within the Cecilia architecture, is a significant contribution. The integration of knowledge graphs with dynamic programming for generating personalized dialogue scripts is a unique aspect. The paper effectively bridges theoretical AI concepts with a practical application.

**Actionable Feedback for Improvement:**

1.  **Sharpen the distinction from existing work on dialogue generation:** While the paper does a good job of relating its work to existing chat-bot and AI research in Section 2, it could further emphasize the *unique* contribution of CCP. Specifically, how does optimizing dialogue composition based on a formal optimization problem (CCP) differentiate itself from more heuristic or rule-based dialogue generation systems?
2.  **Highlight the "creative" aspect more explicitly:** The term "Creative Composition Problem" implies a generative or novel aspect beyond just optimization. While the composition of dialogue scripts is inherently creative, the paper could more explicitly articulate *how* the proposed method fosters creativity in the dialogue generation process, rather than just optimal sequencing. For example, does the combination of various AI-tasks lead to emergent conversational patterns?
3.  **Elaborate on the "optimal solution" vs. "feasible solution" implications:** While the distinction is made, further discussion on what constitutes a "feasible" dialogue composition versus an "optimal" one in terms of user experience could be beneficial. Are there scenarios where a slightly suboptimal but more natural dialogue is preferred over a strictly optimized but potentially stilted one?

---

### Criterion 4: Presentation and Organization

**Score: 4.0/5.0**

**Justification:**
The paper is generally well-organized and follows a logical flow, starting with the problem definition, moving to technical details, and concluding with results and future work. The use of headings, subheadings, and figures (especially the architecture diagrams) aids readability. The references are extensive and appropriately formatted.

**Actionable Feedback for Improvement:**

1.  **Improve Figure Captions and References:** Some figure captions are quite brief (e.g., "Fig. 1. Architecture of Cecilia logical-based AI agent digital companion system."). Adding a sentence or two to each caption to briefly explain what the figure illustrates or highlights would be beneficial. Additionally, ensure consistent referencing of figures and tables within the text.
2.  **Consistency in Terminology:** While generally consistent, occasionally terms like "CCP" and "PCDC" are used interchangeably without explicit clarification of which is the general problem and which is the specific instantiation. Ensuring precise and consistent use of these acronyms throughout the text would improve clarity. For example, explicitly stating "CCP, which is instantiated as PCDC for dialogue composition" at key points.
3.  **Streamline the "Related Work" Section:** The "Related Work" section is comprehensive but could be slightly more streamlined. Consider grouping similar types of prior work more explicitly or using bullet points for quicker scanning of the contributions of various studies. Ensure that the connection of each related work to the current paper's contribution is made clear and concise.

---

### Criterion 5: Clarity of Language and Writing Style

**Score: 4.5/5.0**

**Justification:**
The language is generally clear, professional, and academic. The authors demonstrate a strong command of technical terminology. The explanations are detailed, and the writing style is suitable for a research paper.

**Actionable Feedback for Improvement:**

1.  **Proofread for Minor Grammatical Errors and Typos:** While the paper is well-written, a thorough proofreading pass could catch minor grammatical slips or typos that might momentarily distract the reader. For instance, on page 1, "by herself" is used twice in quick succession, which could be slightly rephrased for variety.
2.  **Enhance Flow Between Paragraphs:** In some instances, the transition between paragraphs could be smoother. Consider using more explicit transition words or phrases to connect ideas more seamlessly, especially when moving from one technical concept to another. For example, when shifting from defining the CCP to discussing its dynamic programming solution.
3.  **Define Acronyms Upon First Use (Consistently):** While most acronyms are defined, ensure this is done consistently for all abbreviations upon their first appearance. For instance, the Creative Commons license details on page 30 are clear, but ensure that any other abbreviations introduced are similarly defined on their initial use to maintain reader accessibility.
